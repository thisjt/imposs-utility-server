# IMPOSS Utility Server

Utility server for the IMPOSS Application Service.

This will run in my broken phone connected to the internet somewhere.

Running this server will provide analytics, backup, logging, and status endpoints for the
IMPOSS application that will help in monitoring the application and creating backups of the database.
